# Themed Clock

This project is a simple digital clock that supports **light**, **dark**, and **neon** themes. The clock displays the current time and allows users to switch between different visual modes for a customized experience.

## Features

- **Clock Display**: Shows the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light, dark, and neon themes for different visual styles.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Themes

1. **Light Theme**: Clean and minimal design with bright colors for daytime use.
2. **Dark Theme**: Dark background and softer colors for night or low-light environments.
3. **Neon Theme**: Vibrant, glowing colors for a fun, retro aesthetic.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/themed-clock.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd themed-clock
    ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the clock and test the themes.

## Usage

- The clock starts running as soon as the page loads.
- Use the theme toggle buttons (or dropdown) to switch between **light**, **dark**, and **neon** modes.
- Customize the themes or add new ones by editing the CSS file (`styles.css`).

## Customization

- **Change the theme colors**: You can modify the colors for each theme in the `styles.css` file under the relevant sections (light, dark, and neon).
- **Add new themes**: Simply add a new CSS class for a theme and update the theme toggle logic in the `script.js` file.
- **Time format**: The default format is 24-hour, but you can modify it to 12-hour (with AM/PM) in `script.js`.

## Dependencies

- **None**: This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
